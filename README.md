    username, password, email, and optional start date of bootcamp.

    This page will have all of the currently available resources for students. 

4. After they populate the resource list, they are taken to their profile where they
    can display the list. They can then add more items, delete more items, or select 
    individual items for editing.

    The resource list in profile will display the name of the resource, the description,
    whether or not it is completed, the aggregate rating of the resource, and the image or
    a default image associated with the resource.

    the profile page and can do all the usual profile page functions.

5. When a user selects an individual resource to edit they are taken to a single-view
    page where they can edit the notes, whether they completed the course, and their
    rating of the course.
