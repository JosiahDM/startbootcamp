### Goal

The goal with this project was to create a full stack web application from the ground up. The requirements were to create a fully developed database schema, fully functioning CRUD capabilities, a user login with varying user privileges, a session object, and a way to track a user's experiences on the site.

### Features/Details

Successfully completed all requirements of the project. Some key features include:
- User login and authentication. Successful login creates a session object for the given user which is used to track activity.
- Ability for user to create new resources or add resources to the app.
- Tag system that allows users to add tags to resources they have added. A user can add a maximum of 3 tags to each resource in their list. Resources can't have duplicate tags, or empty string tags.

- Privileged admin user which can modify/delete other users, tags, and resources.
- Fully responsive and beautiful front end.
