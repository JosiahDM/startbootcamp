# startbootcamp
A prep program for people starting coding bootcamps. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### User Stories


1. User goes to website and can view the main page with list of currently popular topics. 
    They can choose to simply browse the topics or decide to sign up, or log in.

2. If they choose to sign up, they are prompted with a form to input their name,
    username, password, email, and optional start date of bootcamp.

3. When they sign up, they are brought to a page to populate their resource list.
    This page will have all of the currently available resources for students. 

4. After they populate the resource list, they are taken to their profile where they
    can display the list. They can then add more items, delete more items, or select 
    individual items for editing.

    The resource list in profile will display the name of the resource, the description,
    whether or not it is completed, the aggregate rating of the resource, and the image or
    a default image associated with the resource. 

    - If they already have an account and login from the home page, they are taken straight to 
    the profile page and can do all the usual profile page functions.

5. When a user selects an individual resource to edit they are taken to a single-view
    page where they can edit the notes, whether they completed the course, and their
    rating of the course.
